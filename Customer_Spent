Two tables: CUSTOMER,INVOICE. 
CUSTOMER table contains: id, cust_name,city_id,cust_add,contact,email,phone,is_active as column names. 
INVOICE table contains: id,invoice_number,customer_id,total_price as columns. 
CUSTOMER.id=INVOICE.customer_id. 
Create an oracle sql query to list all the customers who spent 25% or less on the average amount spent on all the invoices. 
  Also for each customer display their name and amount spent to 6 decimal places.  Order the result by the amount spent from high to low.

SELECT
    C.cust_name,
    TO_CHAR(SUM(I.total_price), '9999999.999999') AS amount_spent
FROM
    CUSTOMER C
JOIN
    INVOICE I ON C.id = I.customer_id
GROUP BY
    C.id, C.cust_name
HAVING
    ROUND(SUM(I.total_price) / (SELECT AVG(total_price) FROM INVOICE), 6) <= 0.25
ORDER BY
    amount_spent DESC;
